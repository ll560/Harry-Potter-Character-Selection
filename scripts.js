//tried to solve this 2 ways. One of them worked.....which one?



// Create a function called flexIt(), which should find the first element with the class called 'needFlex' and add the class flexIt to that element and then toggle the flexIt class on and off each time that function is called by the user clicking the button that says "Flex houses".


const flexIt = () => {
    firstElement = document.querySelector("needFlex");
    
}
